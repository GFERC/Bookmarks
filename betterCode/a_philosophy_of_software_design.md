## Preface
The most fundamental problem in computer science is problem decomposition: how to take a complex problem and divide it up into pieces that
can be solved independently.

## Chapter 1
### High level 2 ways to fighting complexity
The first approach is to eliminate complexity by making code simpler and more obvious. For example, complexity can be reduced by eliminating special cases or using identifiers in a consistent fashion.

The second approach to complexity is to encapsulate it, so that programmers can work on a system without being exposed to all of its complexity at once. This approach is called modular design. In modular design, a software system is divided up into modules, such as classes in an object-oriented language. The modules are designed to be relatively independent of each other, so that a programmer can work on one module without having to understand the details of other modules.
### Symptoms of complexity
1. Change amplification
2. Cognitive load
3. Unknown unknowns
