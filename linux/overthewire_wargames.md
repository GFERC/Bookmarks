### L4: find the human-readable files
I used file command file <file name> to find out the type of a
file.Human -reable files are ASCII files.  
  
### L5: find files of a certain size
use -size n[cwbkMG] to find files with matching size. It actually just returned one and the result also matches the otehr 2 requirement. See more on fine -size in [here](http://www.ducea.com/2008/02/12/linux-tips-find-all-files-of-a-particular-size/)
